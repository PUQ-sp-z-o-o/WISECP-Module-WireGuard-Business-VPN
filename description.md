The WireGuard Business-VPN module is designed to provide a customizable Virtual Private Network service for business clients who have the capability to independently manage their VPN accounts.

At its core, the module gives the end customer control over a group of VPN account entries, allowing them to add, remove, block, and perform port forwarding on these accounts. All accounts are part of a unified network and share a common external IP address. Additionally, there's a feature enabling internal traffic to be routed among these accounts.

This innovative system empowers end clients to establish corporate private networks tailored to their own customers. With the flexibility to manage VPN accounts and the added functionality of internal traffic forwarding, businesses can customize their VPN service to meet the specific needs of their clientele.
